# Owl

> **⚠️ Beta Software** — Owl is in early development and not yet ready for production use. APIs, configuration, and UI are subject to change without notice.

A visual diff viewer for local Git worktrees and past commits. Owl renders unified and split diffs with syntax highlighting, a file tree sidebar, and inline comment annotations. It runs entirely against your local repository — no pull requests, no URLs, just your working copy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3 or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) 2.30 or later
- A local Git repository (worktree) to inspect

### Installation

```sh
git clone <repo-url> && cd owl
bun install
```

### Running the Dev Server

```sh
export OWL_WORKTREE_PATH=/absolute/path/to/your/git/repo   # optional; defaults to current directory
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view the app.

- **Vite dev server** runs on port `5173` and serves the React frontend with HMR.
- **Hono API server** runs on port `3000`. In development, Vite proxies `/api` requests to it automatically.

The target directory must be a valid Git working tree.

## Configuration

| Environment Variable   | Required | Default             | Description                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `OWL_WORKTREE_PATH`    | No       | `$PWD` (server CWD) | Absolute path to the Git worktree to inspect.        |

All configuration is server-side via environment variables. There is no `.env` file or runtime config UI at this stage.

---

## API

The Hono server exposes a single API endpoint:

| Method | Path                       | Description                                    |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/api/local-worktree-diff` | Returns the full diff of the current worktree. |

**Response**

- **200** — Raw unified diff text (`text/plain`).
- **422** — No local changes (body: `"No local changes in the current worktree."`).
- **500** — Git command failed (body contains the error message).

The response includes the headers:

- `X-Patch-Source: local-worktree`
- `Cache-Control: no-store`

## Scripts

| Command            | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `bun dev`          | Start Vite + Hono dev servers concurrently           |
| `bun run build`    | Production build (`vite build`)                     |
| `bun start`        | Start the production Hono server                     |
| `bun typecheck`    | Run TypeScript type checking (`tsgo --noEmit`)      |
| `bun lint`         | Run `oxlint` on all source files                    |
| `bun lint:fix`     | Auto-fix lint issues                                |
| `bun fmt`          | Format all files with `oxfmt`                       |
| `bun fmt:check`    | Check formatting compliance                         |
| `bun check`        | Format check + lint + typecheck (CI gate)           |
| `bun fix`          | Format and auto-fix lint issues in place            |

Run `bun check` before committing. It ensures formatting, linting, and type checking all pass.

## Architecture

- **Frontend** is a single-page React application bootstrapped in `src/frontend/main.tsx`. It communicates exclusively with the Hono API server at `/api`.
- **Server** is a thin Hono app that spawns `git` child processes to generate diffs. All Git operations are server-side only and scoped to the worktree configured via `OWL_WORKTREE_PATH`.
- **Diff rendering** uses `@pierre/diffs` for parsing and rendering unified diffs, with syntax highlighting offloaded to web workers for responsiveness on large patches.
- **File tree** is powered by `@pierre/trees`, which builds a hierarchical file listing from the diff output and annotates each entry with its Git change type.
